# Sentiment-Analysis-Deep-Learning-Project-Phase-1
phase 1 of a multy-modal sentiment analysis project:

The first phase of this deep learning project is focused on analyzing emotions in images using multiple modalities, including pictures, text, and voice. Phase 1 comprises of four stages aimed at achieving the main goal of identifying emotions based on the use of the images in the dataset.

In the first stage, we will utilize facial recognition algorithms to extract key features from faces within the images. We will train the model to recognize emotional cues such as eye movements, facial expressions, and other subtle nuances that can indicate different emotional states. This will enable the system to accurately identify emotions expressed by individuals in the images.

In the second stage, we will analyze the entire image using feature extraction techniques to determine the sentiment of the content. By extracting relevant features such as color, texture, shape, and composition, we can gain insights into the overall mood and tone of the image. This will provide additional context to further refine the sentiment analysis.

In the third stage, we will combine the results obtained from both stages to develop a comprehensive sentiment analysis model. By fusing the data from facial recognition and image feature extraction, we can achieve a more accurate understanding of the emotions conveyed in the images.

Finally, in the fourth stage, we will evaluate the performance of the model to ensure its efficacy in accurately predicting sentiment based on the images in the dataset. This evaluation will help us fine-tune the model for enhanced accuracy and efficiency in subsequent stages of the project.
